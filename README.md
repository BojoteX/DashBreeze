# DashBreeze

DashBreeze is a SimHub plugin designed to control fans based on your simulator's speed telemetry data, simulating the feeling of wind rushing against your face.

## Features

- Maps in-game speed to a fan speed percentage.
- Adjusts fan speed based on a customizable intensity setting.
- Automatically detects and connects to compatible devices via serial ports.

## Installation

To install the DashBreeze plugin, download the DLL file from the repository and place it in the same directory where SimHub is installed. If you don't have the DashBreeze control unit you can use an Arduino Leonardo and upload the custom sketch included in the Hardware directory.

## Usage

Once installed, DashBreeze should be available as a plugin in SimHub. Refer to SimHub's plugin usage guide for further instructions.
